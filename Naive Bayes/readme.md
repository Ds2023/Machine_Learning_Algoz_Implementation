## Task Background

For this activity, you work for a firm that provides insights for management and coaches in the National Basketball Association (NBA), a professional basketball league in North America. The league is interested in retaining players who can last in the high-pressure environment of professional basketball and help the team be successful over time. In the previous activity, you analyzed a subset of data that contained information about the NBA players and their performance records. 

You'll conduct feature engineering to determine which features would most effectively predict a player's career duration. You'll then use those insights to build a model that predicts whether a player will have an NBA career lasting five years or more.
